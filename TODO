- Tests, lots of tests. Particularly for the processor and the player backend.

Web UI
======
- Advanced search? e.g. watched, specifying categories
- Auto refresh UI when shows update?
- /modify/series/<id>
- Playlist?
- Season toggleWatched
- Settings, make add new source not ugly
- Settings, validation
- /modify/movie/<id>, validation
- Nice slider
- Position slider
- Player needs a lot of love for appearance and functionality
- Kick off update from UI.
- Figure out why client websockets are locking up
- Make ws:// URIs relative
- When subtitles are downloading, show this fact

Subtitle downloader
===================
- support multicd movies?
- support episodes
- Trim out the stupid "Shop this show's fashion on LookLive.com" garbage from
  downloaded subtitles.
- Support thesubdb and more

Player
======
- Figure out if there's anything distinguishing about streams with repeating
  names (e.g. channels and stuff) and display that in audio choices


Processor
=========
- More robust
- More logging
- Make processor respect timer option
- More plugin-based architecture, for adding new scrapers?
- Make service based?

Misc
====
- Deluge integration?
- Expose videos that aren't in the library
- support nfs/ftp/cifs? CIFS & FTP looks nice and easy, mplayer supports them natively.
  nfs could be supported by mounting sources under ~/.config/aesop/nfs/ I
  suppose, though that's pretty unpleasant.
- UI for the OMDB TSV dump, and support for pulling data out of it
- UPnP server, specifically one that doesn't run so poorly.
